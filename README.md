# PyTango Device Server for NETIO 230B Extention Cord

## Requirements
`pip install Adafruit-BME280`

`pip install Adafruit-GPIO`

AM2315.py and AM2315BME280MuxCtrl.py must be in the same directory (or the import statement in AM2315BME280MuxCtrl.py has to be changed)

## Troubleshooting
If sensors are connected but the device Server is not receving data. Disconnect and Reconnect the Sensors.
